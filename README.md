# DK's dotfiles

Configuration featuring `zsh`, `neovim`, `tmux`, `alacritty` and various
linux/unix configs all handled by `dotbot`.

Linux config uses i3 and polybar. Definitely a WIP.

# Installation
- Run `make help` to see all options.
- Run `make dotbot-run` to execute the dotbot installation script.

### TODO
- Make fully compatible between x86 and apple silicon.
- Make fully compatible between darwin and linux.
